the answer was instead a solution: pursuing a holistic approach to
specialization and encouraging designers to should they wish to do so).
At Mäd we approach projects with a few key priorities in mind: Enhance
Empathy. Improve we try to reach a mutual understanding between
designers work on the usability layout and visual appearance of the
digital product or platform. which essentially makes the product work.
If there is no code there is no functionality in the product and it is
virtually inoperable. Developers convert building features and
functionality via code to create the final working it can be challenging
for them to fully understand each other\'s methods tools and
capabilities. Designers can relatively but they often lack the
understanding of the it\'s important to note that a whether we\'re
helping clients on a digital transformation project or collaborating the
relationship between design and development can make or break the end
product design and development have a shared objective: to bring a
complete workable and smooth digital product to life.  companies follow
a process in which design begins the project and later hands this over
to developers to the two teams don\'t get in stages.  it\'s even more
important to clearly establish the goals and any intricacies of the
project it is not uncommon that it\'s vital to already involve both
design and development at this requests for additional features and so
on. It will also help designers avoid developers (whether internal or
external) need to set tasks by order of priority. They should provide a
list of the most following a timeline set by priority.  designers can
track how the UX/UI features will translate from scoping and design to
development and testing. there shouldn\'t even be a gap like this that
they are working one at a time not simultaneously. As we\'ve established
earlier they should be collaborating from the early they will have each
other\'s best interests in mind from the start and have better awareness
of each other\'s needs until completion. which is where designers are
visualizing and drafting the \"skeleton\" of the digital designers
should try to keep their work as tidy and comprehensive as we champion a
\"lean\" approach to design and development versus the more commonly
used\"waterfall\" and the assumption here is that projects have a linear
structure with milestones that are passed one after the design and
development teams (especially if not under the same company) this
approach simply doesn\'t work as however projects have an iterative
structure meaning that our designers and test and revise the product
until they\'re satisfied with the end result. In doing this it\'s much
easier for by adopting a lean approach anything that doesn\'t we favor
splitting projects into batches. By breaking down the requirements of a
particular project into manageable chunks it allows designers and
developers to work in parallel and encourages higher involvement from
both it\'s also helpful such as \\\<a

terms of human-centered design which is generally a core principle

for optimizing so many crucial features of the user experience. Having
the ability to empathize will hugely enhance the relationship between

Design Handoff. \"It is common for \"\\\<p id=\"\"\"\"\\\>Whether
you\'re a digital startup in its early stages or an large-scale company
you will already know that it is incredibly challenging to propel a
product from idea to launch without comments and revisions that can
hamper progress.  it is still common practice for designers to hand it
over to developers and conclude their involvement in the project. With
this structure in place it is not unusual to experience friction between
design and development.  a product team consists of both the designers
and the developers engineer the designers\' work into the functioning
product or platform that and development without
design. \`\</strong\>\`{=html}‍ but this doesn\'t always prevent issues
in the handoff process. The but omitting the design phase means that the
it is the designers who prioritize the end-user and thus plan and
structure such as interactions or micro-animations will be missed making
its visual aspect both incomplete and it\'s the design that truly
enhances the it is impossible to eliminate there will not be a
real-world product only a collection of designs and prototypes.  Why Are
Handoffs Necessary? \`\</strong\>\`{=html} let\'s first define the
purpose of a handoff.  we distinguish between two types of design
whereby the design team completes the designs hands their work over to
development and then moves on to the design and development teams are
working while designers continue supporting the product\'s development
until it is ready to launch.  seamless handoff the product team needs to
start preparing well in advance. They the team can navigate these
pitfalls by and by cultivating early and continuous just to touch base
and keep everyone updated on the progress of the project. This will help
avoid misunderstandings that there are a number of essential items to be
included in the shared file. Usually the handoff will consist of the
following: flows and mockups. iterate and ship better products \-- they
act as a unified visual language for the entire team ensuring
consistency in product design and but also about making the product
functionally accessible both to the product team and measurements and
style guides of components and patterns. Ideally you\'ll have shared the
entire design system at the beginning of the in which case these details
will already be specified. Pay attention to the design team should be
able to provide high-fidelity screen designs. These will help make user
flows and other processes more understandable to you should have a
complete image of the product so it\'s helpful to identify and ensure
that file names clearly indicate their purpose in an easily
understandable component names should include the details of the
variations of the and should follow a consistent and make sure that
it\'s clear where design and copy should exist cohesively so it\'s
important to clearly record all the copy with whether/when a outline the
primary UX flows and even give a glimpse of the animations and
interactions. It lets developers evaluate whether the interface design
is realistic and how it it\'s best to organize these into annotated
flows and interactions so that developers know how to screen-capture
this step might require a conversation with the developer to clarify
your annotate and document everything.\`\</strong\>\`{=html} it is
helpful for designers to add detailed notes to the files that \\\<a

id=\"\"\"\"\\\>InVision\`\</a\>\`{=html} and \\\<a have a list of all
the features and flows that need to be designed. It is also helpful to
flag the status of each item \-- whether it is in progress or
completed.  it\'s essential for designers to provide a resource with all

from keeping everything in one the lines of communication need to be
kept open so that the handover of material would occur after the
designer has completed crafting all the possible components and flows
\-- that is at the end of the design phase and before the development
phase begins.  in an ideal scenario the order of things should be
different.  the product-building at the start of the project the design
team creates wireframes that are shared with the development team. It is
at this point of the process that as they will have an idea of the full
scope of the or MVP). This allows designers to hand over work in and
make any necessary changes a handoff is still happening but in a

efficient way to compile what has already outline the next steps and

Here it\'s important to communicate everything in clear and universal
terms avoiding jargon: minimizing the knowledge gaps the stages of
